Morse code is inputted via command line when the program is ran. If the morse code is correct, it will output the the English translation. This program not only translates the English alphabet, but it also translates numbers as well. 

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
