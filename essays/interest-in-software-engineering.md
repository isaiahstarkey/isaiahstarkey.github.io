There are many things about software engineering that fascinate me. Athough I have have only scratched the surface of software engineering, there is a sense of comradary in which you are able to work together to solve problems or birth new ideas. I believe that learning together and networking with others is a key benefit that comes with working on software engineering.

Ever sinc I was a child, I had an interest in solving puzzles. Wether it was a simple jigsaw puzzle or a challegning sudoku puzzle, I enjoyed doing them, and maybe the idea of "strengthening my brain" keep driving me to continue on doing these puzzles. Software engineering is right up my alley because it is like solving puzzles, albeit you are are trying to figure out why a certain piece of code is not working, it is a puzzle nonetheless, and it is fun to do.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
