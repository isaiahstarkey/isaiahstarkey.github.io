There are many things about software engineering that fascinate me. Athough I have have only scratched the surface of software engineering, there is a sense of comradary in which you are able to work together to solve problems or birth new ideas. I believe that learning together and networking with others is a key benefit that comes with working on software engineering.

Ever since I was a child, I had an interest in solving puzzles. Whether it was a simple jigsaw puzzle or a challegning sudoku puzzle, I enjoyed doing them, and maybe the idea of "strengthening my brain" keep driving me to continue on doing these puzzles. Software engineering is right up my alley because it is like solving puzzles, albeit you are are trying to figure out why a certain piece of code is not working, it is a puzzle nonetheless, and it is fun to do.

I hope my interest and curiousity for software engineering grows bigger as I learn more about it. I want to be able to use the knowledge that I gain from software engineering in real life scenarios. If I could make life just a little easier because of software engineering, then I all the knowledge that I have and will gain will all be worth it.
