## Are Coding Standards Really Necessary?

First of all, what are coding standards? Coding standards are sets of rules and procedures that can be specified on different programming languages or development enviroments. Now when it comes to coding standards, the question that I have asked myself a handful of times is "are coding standards really necessary?" Of course I want the code that I write to be pretty and uniform as possible, but is it possible for coding standards to have a greater function rather than just making your code look good? I for one think it does. 

For starters, coding standards help reduce errors in your code. Whether you forgot the syntax or just made a typo, coding standards help verify what you typed is actually right. I can see coding standards being important in larger software development where multiple programmers are working on one project. Different programmers have different programming styles, but with coding standards, it helps keep the code consisntent, and it brings a less likely chance to have "spaghetti code" within your programs. 

## First Impressions Are Always Important

After using the coding standards ESLint on Intellij for about a week now, I can say that it is very helpful when programming. Although I like to think that I write fairly clean code, ESLint helps keep me in check by telling me when I forget to input a space or when I forget to input a semicolon. Since I am still a beginnger at JavaScript, ESLint also lets me know when my syntax is wrong and provides fixes for them as well. When something in your code doesn't confrom to the ESLint standards, it underlines the problem with a red line. For someone who isn't familiar with ESLint, this is like in Microsoft Word where it underlines misspelled words and provides the correct spelling for you. This allows you to know where the problem is exactly, and you don't need to go through your code line-by-line trying to debug it, and probably ripping your hair out in the process. 

After everything is said and done, ESLint lets you know if you still have any errors in your code by providing a red 'x' on the top right of your window, or a green checkmark if you don't have any errors at all. Getting that illustrious green checkmark can be a bit tricky at times especially if you don't know why ESLint is giving you a certain error, but it is also give you a little piece of mind in knowing that you don't have any errors in your code. 

## Final Thoughts

So, are coding standards important? Is ESLint useful in when programming? I can't speak for anyone else, but I think that coding standards are important, and they should always be implemented. I don't think I can find any drawbacks for using ESLint or coding standards in general. Coding standards aren't designed to stop you from programming a certain way. Coding standards only help you become a better programmer by guiding you through your mistakes. If every programmer used them now, there will be much less headache in the future when you have to go back and update your code.
