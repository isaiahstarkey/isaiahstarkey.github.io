## Are Coding Standards Really Necessary?

First of all, what are coding standards? Coding standards are sets of rules and procedures that can be specified on different programming languages or development enviroments. Now when it comes to coding standards, the question that I have asked myself a handful of times is "are coding standards really necessary?" Of course I want the code that I write to be pretty and uniform as possible, but is it possible for coding standards to have a greater function rather than just making your code look good? I for one think it does. 

For starters, coding standards help reduce errors in your code. Whether you forgot the syntax or just made a typo, coding standards help verify what you typed is actually right. I can see coding standards being important in larger software development where multiple programmers are working on one project. Different programmers have different programming styles, but with coding standards, it helps keep the code consisntent and the less likely chance to have "spaghetti code".
