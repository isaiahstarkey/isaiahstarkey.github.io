## Stupid Questions Do Exist

Picture this, you have a programming assignment due at midnight, and you are typing furiously to get it finished on time. Along the way you come across an error message in your code, and after spending hours trying to debug your code you turn to the internet to help you fix your problem. As I scour the net for help, I always notice the amount of bad questions that I have to filter out before I can find a question pertaining to my problem. Bad questions are not only a waste of time, but they also offer no help to the answerer  trying to answer these questions as these questions are often times vague and confusing. 

## The Good

In order to receive smart answers, you must ask smart questions. This may seem easy to understand, but some people are still out there asking bad questions. As a computer science student, I often see myself using StackOverflow to help me answer any questions that I have pertaining to a certain coding language or to computer science in general. If I have a question, then that same questions has probably already been asked and answered on StackOverflow.

In the following example, we see a simple, yet effective, question that deals with JavaScript’s let and var statements. 

```
What's the difference between using “let” and “var”?
 
ECMAScript 6 introduced the let statement.
I've heard it that it's described as a "local" variable, but I'm still not quite sure how it behaves differently than the var keyword.
What are the differences? When should let be used over var?
```
This question interested me as I am just starting to learn about JavaScript and knowing the differences between the two keywords may help later in the future. The question itself is short and simple, but that is what makes it a smart question. Smart questions do not have to be overly complicated or have paragraphs worth of text. They have to be precise and informative. The original question what to the point, and the asker also provides additional details about his question. This question goes to show that longer that always mean better.
